## RUNGIST
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Djo/rungist.png "Build Status")](http://travis-ci.org/Djo/rungist)

This is the Yet Another Try Ruby. It allows you to run a github's gist in the ruby sandbox.  
The rungist uses iframes to display the result, it's possible to run the ERB template and apply styles to the output.

### Supported formats

* **Ruby** (safe JRuby sandbox)
* **HTML+ERB** (templating system)
* **CSS** (styles are applied to all iframes)

### Under the hood

It was made to show in action: JRuby/Sinatra/Backbone.js, Just for Fun :).  
The code is well-tested and hosted on GitHub.
